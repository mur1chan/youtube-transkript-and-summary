# youtube-transkript-and-summary


This is a Python script that automatically summarizes YouTube video transcripts and interacts with a chatbot using the "chatgpt_class" and "youtube_transcript_api" libraries. The chatbot is based on OpenAI's GPT-3 model and is capable of generating human-like responses to user questions.

To run the script, you first need to insert your YouTube API keys into a file named "api.key.txt". The script will then prompt for the YouTube video ID and automatically download the transcript of the video. The transcript will then be analyzed using the GPT-3 model to generate a summarized response to user questions.

The summary will be saved in a separate file named "transcript_summary.txt", while the original transcript will be saved in a file named "transcript.txt".

This script is useful for users who want a quick and easy way to summarize YouTube video transcripts and interact with a chatbot to answer their questions.
